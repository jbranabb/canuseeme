            I actually didn‚Äôt plan to take Software Engineering at first.
            When I entered vocational high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do ‚Äî I even picked Marketing as my first choice.
            But during the placement test, I was assigned to Software Engineering (RPL). At first, I was confused and unsure if I could fit in.
            Still, I decided to keep going ‚Äî and that decision completely changed how I see technology and myself.

            I started learning whatever I needed to understand how things worked.
            I still remember one of my first experiments ‚Äî a Python script that generated flowers.
            Honestly, it wasn‚Äôt even my code; I just cloned it from GitHub and ran it.
            But when it worked, I was so proud that I showed it to my crush.
            I kinda miss those days ‚Äî when everything felt new and exciting.</p>

            2023 was my curiosity hit a new level.
            I started diving deeper into tech ‚Äî from web development to experimenting with new tools.
            That year, I installed WSL for the first time and explored the Linux environment just to understand how things worked under the hood.
            I even bought an Arduino and started tinkering with IoT projects, trying to see how the physical and digital worlds could connect.
            2023 was the year I realized that learning never stops ‚Äî there‚Äôs always something new to explore.

            In 2024, I started focusing more on mobile development, especially with Java.
            It was my first step into building real mobile applications ‚Äî not just learning syntax, but understanding how everything connects.
            That year, I built a project as part of my final requirement before moving up to 12th grade.
            It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it made me realize how much I enjoyed turning ideas into something people could actually use.

            After all the lessons, I‚Äôm still learning new things. This year, I‚Äôve been more into server development and exploring how everything connects behind the scenes.</p>

            But the biggest move in 2025 ‚Äî I made Flutter my main framework.
            It‚Äôs where I feel most confident now.
            I understand how state management works, how to connect APIs, and how to turn ideas into real apps.
            Feels like I‚Äôve found my zone.

            I‚Äôm planning to get a Mac someday and start learning Swift, but for now, I‚Äôm fully committed to my setup.
            Oh, and yeah ‚Äî 2025 marks the year I officially switched to Linux.
            No dual boot, no turning back.  Feels kinda different, but in a good way.
            Just me, my terminal, and the freedom to build whatever I want. üêß </p>
